1. Built the [PIN tracer](pin_tracer), following the instructions in the [corresponding README](pin_tracer/README.md).
2. Copy the `Task9Tracer.dll` to the directory with the prepared binary `serpentine4_p1.exe`. Use `run_text.bat` and then `run_me.bat` to produce traces.
3. Merge the obtained traces using the script: [`cleanup.py`](cleanup.py). You should obtain results similar to: [`listings/t1_vs_t2.txt`](listings/t1_vs_t2.txt)
